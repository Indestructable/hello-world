Hello fellow programmers!

I like to play video games and sports. Very balanced I would say!
I also like to watch TV and movies.
My favorite movie series is...

STAR WARS!

Anyway I have only done simple programming and fiqured it would nice to start some real stuff.
This is my first repositiory.

Bye for now!
